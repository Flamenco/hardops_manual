## [Blender Hard Surface Tips : Hardops (By: Jayanam)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltuD1wg9MoE)

Jayanam did a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltuD1wg9MoE) about [HOPS 0093](https://gumroad.com/l/hardops/). I wanted to add a few notes on it as well as add it to the [docs](https://hardops-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- By using x-sym you could put a loop on the origin on the x. That would save 6 keystrokes for removing the corner nodes

- ssharpening objects before booleans can work well

- with bwidth pressing A will turn on Adaptive mode which is an alternate dynamic bwidth that will add segments as needed based off of scale.

- sometime you should try the following. hops boolean >> q >> tthick. Its pretty nice to use as well.

- try adding an edge before booleans sometime it makes the result much more predictable.

- Also lowering the bweight of certain selections will allow users multiple levels of bevel weight within the same model.

- By enabling pro mode in H9 prefs, you have an additional edit mode option called demote. It will clean the sharps enough for manual bevelling with ctrl + B.
