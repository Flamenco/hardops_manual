## Boxcutter 

> Boxcutter is a tool built to expand on the workflows of Hard Ops. It was created
primarily by [Adrian Rutkowski](https://www.artstation.com/artist/adrianrutkowski)
with myself managing this project. We also were assisted by Dairin0d and Edgard
for the later releases among a few others. In the same vein of Hard Ops, Boxcutter
is intended to become something more.
