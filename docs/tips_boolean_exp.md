### Boolean Tips

## Boolean Combos

# Example 1 (Boolean / cSlash )

Below are some examples of how I make shapes using booleans in Hard Ops. It's also important to note that I am modifing the boolshape before csharpening the main form. Otherwise it would be applied.

To discuss this first example:

- subtractive boolean with ctrl + numpad minus. Then boolshape Q menu to bevel for roundness
- csharp to apply and sharpen
- tthick to expand area reach of boolshape. Press 2 to push in and out during modal
- subtractive boolean then used the Q >> Cslash to get the cutaway back.

The shape is re-usable at this point to do cutaways on other areas of the mesh if the user desires.

# Example 2 (Boolean / tThick)

In this example I do a simple cut with a cube and after rounding the corners add solidify to create a panel cut. Here you can see the separations of objects.
