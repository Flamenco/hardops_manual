## Ssharpen

>Ssharpen is the base of the sharpening system and is a foundational element of
Hard Ops. The idea of Ssharpen came through the collaborations of myself and AR
which also was the base of Csharpen as well.

People always ask what is the difference between the two.

Ssharpen is a calculator. It also sets the mesh up for hard surface modelling.
In short. Ssharpen

     -goes into edit mode unhides the mesh and deselects all.
          selects sharps edges via select >> sharp edges.
     -edges are marked with bevel,sharp,crease
     -autosmooth is activated at a 60 degree angle

So this merely sets up a mesh for hard surface rendering and helps it look better
in the 3d view and rendering. This is a rather non-destructive operation and
doesn't affect the mesh negatively. To best understand Ssharpen try doing it
manually. Here is an example of the process.

Alternatively. Here is ssharpen in action.

So ssharpen is a non-destructive process that calculates the shapening based off
of angle. This has a 2nd part that goes deeper but this is the general idea behind
this particular tool.

There is also a video covering this tool as of the 007 release. The ideas remain
the same despite continual enhancements,
