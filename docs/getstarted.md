## How to get started with Hard Ops

Hard Ops can seem daunting however all the commands do basic things. So I recommend learning the ropes on basic objects to practice just to get used to the menus. In the next few examples I'll be going over how I use Hard Ops in my day to day work.

# Ssharp / Csharp Workflow

Try out modelling basic shapes and using the sharpeners. I usually do a small
trial run to warm up with the tools.

> In this example I right clicked my x-symmetrize and remapped it to
alt + x in object mode. This is part of my default scene but we allowed some options
to be able to be right clicked and allowed hotkeys.

Its just a matter of my making mesh changes and adjusting the bwidth. Usually as
the model gets more detailed the bevel size gets shrunk. There is another
 workflow involving cstep however this is a bit more advanced. For now we will focus
 on the csharp / ssharp boolean workflow.

Many of the tools perform ssharp or csharp after the fact in order to do a post
operation surfacing of sorts.

One example would be the cslice. Cslice was made by AR as an alternative to my
rebool. Both of them have their cases and can be used interchagably depending
on the situation.

- rebool requires a pending boolean. Meaning you must set up a boolean with ctrl + (numpad +/-)
- cslice is the process. select two meshes and it will cut. That is all.

> In some cases it's easier to cslice however in the example you can see it did not
 work out so quickly so therefore setting it up was necessary. It's not a matter
 of one over the other but using whichever works best for your needs.

So continuing on. As we make more cuts and the details become closer. Its
important to lower the bevel width distance to keep the mesh looking good.
