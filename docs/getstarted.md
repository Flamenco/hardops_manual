### Getting Started With Hard Ops

Hard Ops can be brought up one of 4 ways. Not to mention the active tool.

## Q  - Menu

Pressing Q will bring up the Hard Ops Q menu.

> The first options will always be dependent on context most of the time.

We'll be going over the options later in depth. See [options](options)

## Shift Q - Pie Menu

Pressing shift + Q will bring up the Hard Ops pie menu. Designed and maintained by [AR](https://twitter.com/AdrianRutk0wski/)

The pie menu is the same as the q menu. Icons are not in the pie menu due to speed issues but is the same format of options as the Q menu. The options change based off of context.

## N - N Panel / Mini Helper

In the vein of most plugins Hard Ops also has a t-panel for options that can be useful for beginners or those who like seeing all the options all the time.

Even in the examples I have a hard time using the T panel. Pressing Q is just so fast.

## Q Menu Option Types

The Q menu options are not just for meshes.

**Camera Q - options**

- simplify will change all the x/y/z parameters of the lattice to 2 simplifying it for large form changes.



**Curve Q - options**

![getstarted](img/getstart/g6.gif)

- 1 curve will allow you to do a 3d taper and set the spans around and along the curve.
- 2 curves will allow you to do a curve taper and set the 2nd curve to the 1st curve as a taper object.

## [hopsTool](https://youtu.be/0qx_hOrW1C8)

[hopsTool](hopsTool.md) was added as of version [00983](https://masterxeon1001.com/2019/09/01/hard-ops-00983-update-log/).

Designed by AR and enhanced for released via collaboration hopsTool is the first active tool of HardOps and serves as a nice playground for non destructive modelling.

hopsTool can be started via the Npanel. Once started the [topbar](https://twitter.com/mxeon1001/status/1123820309168177154) will populate with items.

Here is an example of merging a cube into a vert then making a simple non destructive object.

Scrolling through the modstack can be useful for troubleshooting as well.
