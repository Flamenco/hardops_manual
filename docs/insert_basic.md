## Insert System

Hard Ops has an insert system for using premade meshes for quick greebling and detail work. It's intended to be used in a pinch when detail is needed quickly.

The insert system can be brought up via the Q menu via inserts and also has a top option for an asset scroller which allows you to cycle through assets.
