### [Insert System](https://masterxeon1001.com/2019/02/24/kitops-1-11-update-notes/)

Inserts have been [handed off](https://masterxeon1001.com/2019/02/24/kitops-1-11-update-notes/) to [Kitops from 2.8 onward.](https://gumroad.com/l/kitops)

For those who miss the inserts we do offer [classic inserts for Kitops ](https://gumroad.com/l/hopsclassicinserts).

# [Kitops](https://gumroad.com/l/kitops) w/ [hardOps](https://gumroad.com/l/hopsclassicinserts)

When [Kitops free](https://gumroad.com/l/kitops) or [pro](https://gumroad.com/l/kitopsprolite/) is installed a new button is added to the main Q menu.

[Kitops](https://gumroad.com/l/kitops) can also be accessed from the mini helper. And the N panel kitops area not to mention the kitops N panel.

The hardops version of the [Kitops](https://gumroad.com/l/kitops) panel also has the [mod sorting](sorting.md) at the bottom for easier access than prefs.

# KitOps Popup Update

The kitops popup can now allow for sort modifiers to be turned off. This is essential for non destructive workflows. Sorting will mess up all the work you have done.

Here you can see sorting making inserting a mess.

Without sorting I am able to continue working non destructively without sorting making the stack turn inside out which can be a nightmare if you have 60+ mods!
