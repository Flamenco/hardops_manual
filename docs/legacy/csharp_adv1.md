# Csharp In action

In this example I csharpened the main cube then added a duplicate and used the booltool shortcut of **ctrl + (numpad -)** to cut the cube into the first one.
Then with the primary object selected I used Csharpen to apply the shape while respecting the modfiers in place in order to calculate the new bevelling information as I worked.

After setting up Csharpen I was able to cut the shape and mirror it while also doing subsequent cuts on the object to get additional detail. The important thing to note is how I don't need any additonal UI or buttons. There is hardly a need for the modifier panel or even the T panel. The goal is to make the workflow fast and efficient.
