## Wishlist / Dreams / Roadmap

![](img\dream.gif)

> Our roadmap isn't exactly clear until it begins coming together. Certain requisites must
be met for certain features to become viable. This is always dependant on the people
involved and the time / capacity in dealing with features.

We definetely have our eyes on some big features and even some that have already
come to pass. I am always impressed by the capabilities and skills brought to the
table by people who join the team.

# Hard Ops

- Clickable Buttons in 2d drawing
  > This one is high priority and very important for future ideas as well. With 2d
  clickable buttons we would be able to acheive alternate workflows and greater unification.
  Buttons based off context popping up would work best. This is capable in a limited capacity
  but reactive behavior would work best.

- Unified S/Csharpen S/Cstep Tool
  > Sstatus system would allow for all the sharpeners to be unified reducing
  the need for terminology like ssharpen or csharpen on the user level. Those can
  remain technical terms for internal but for new users it might be daunting.

- Mirror Mirror assimilation of all behaviors of mirroring toolsets
  > An ideal mirror tool would be a unification of all current systems for mirroring.
  This is lower priority due to the needs being fullfilled in the current state but to
  simplify code this would also be best. Mirror Mirror is assimilated however there are still
  other systems that can be merged.

    - Symmetrize and Automirror


- Pizza Ops V2 (customizable locations)
  > Pizza Ops has become cult classic however the functionality is limited.

      - location customization for different regions
      - modal operator drawing a 3d Pizza
      - possible endorsement and image usage
      - easter egg / could be removed

- Consolidation of Buttons
- Wiki live integration
- UI snapshot overlay
- Permeant overlay
- Hops Mode
    > Hops mode is  an idea for a modal mode that would allow for one click
    operators possibly reducing the need for the q menu. While the q menu is the core
    we are always thinking of ways to consolidate all keystrokes.

        - sharpening
        - clearing sharps
        - boolean operations (ctrl + numpad minus / plus / multiply)
        - cstep / sstep  

- Behavior Panel
    > The behavior panel is a panel in the T panel that would be the area where behaviors
    are determined before operators are ran. For example symmetrize can be unified into one
    operator but then in the t panel would be a symmetrize behavior branch. This is just one
    example. Also sharpen would be customized here to determine how the tool behaves when ran.
