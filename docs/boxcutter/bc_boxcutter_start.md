# What is Boxcutter? ![image](..\img\icons\BoxCutter.png)

> Boxcutter is a tool built to expand on the workflows of Hard Ops. It was created
primarily by [Adrian Rutkowski](https://www.artstation.com/artist/adrianrutkowski)
with myself managing this project. We also were assisted by Dairin0d and Edgard
for the later releases among a few others. In the same vein of Hard Ops, Boxcutter
is intended to become something more.

*While they exist as separate products. Boxcutter and Hard Ops were created with
support for one another and it is recommended to use both of them.*

Hard Ops ![](..\img\icons\HardOps.png) is sometimes considered complicated. As the creator
of Hard Ops it's sometimes hard to see how to simplify the process since I understand it
inside and out. Boxcutter is intended to be a soft reboot for hard surface workflows.

# Installing Boxcutter

To start Box cutter you will first need to enable the plugin.

> Using install from file will more than likely **not work**. I would recommend
installing the add-on manually by copying the contents of the zip into the add-on
directory.

Here is where you would locate it on your system.

**Windows**
>When using Blender a folder is created deeply in your PC for add-ons. Putting it
here instead of the branch you are using ensures the next updates also have it
installed.

C:\Users\ **your user** \AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addons\HOps

**Mac**
>Locate Blender in your applications folder

RMB on the blender.app and select show package contents

**Linux:**
>I assume linux users know their PC.

~/.config/blender/2.77/scripts/addons

# Enabling Box Cutter Plugin

After copying the contents of the folder to the correct location you will need
to enable it in add ons.
