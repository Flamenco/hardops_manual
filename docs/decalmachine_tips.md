![img](img/DM/dd1.png)

[decalMACHINE](https://gumroad.com/l/DECALmachine#) is not a tool made by us or is related to HOPS / BC. However it is a tool just as essential and because of that I wanted to write a little bit about my experiences and give some tips.

## Changing Material Colors

# Subsets

For subsets changing the color is just the color node outside of the node group.

# Info

For info decals the color is something you will need to manipulate with a mix node.

If it already has color it can be changed via a HSL node to adjust the tint.

It can be a little odd however I prefer to preview my changes in the render. In this example I use 2 nodes for additional levels of control.
