## Boxcutter Basic Usage  ![image](img\icons\BoxCutter.png)

Boxcutter has a shortcut of **alt + W**

There is also a button in the T-Panel which is located under Hard Ops.

The above image shows me starting it using the button and making a quick cut.

> It's also important to note that when Hard Ops connection is disabled you will
not have any sharpening or csharpening done to the objects. This can be useful if
you dont want to affect the modifiers of the mesh.

The controls are displayed via help and it is recommended to refer to this for the
controls since it may be subject to change in both behaviors and controls in the
future. The fun part about BoxCutter is the constant leaps made in behaviors and
features. We hope to someday unify the tools even more.

For the demos in the manual I will have the Hard Ops connection enabled. I will
also set the snapping to 10.
