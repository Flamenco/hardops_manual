# hopsTool

HardOps version 983 introduces the first active tool of Hard Ops called hopsTool. We intend for this tool to provide a simple ui to assist with modifier management for non destructive modelling in the 3d view.

If boxcutter is not installed the hotkey is alt + shift + W.

If boxcutter is installed then hopsTool is swapable with alt + W.

# Breaking down the UI

[hopsTool will need the topbar to show.](https://twitter.com/mxeon1001/status/1123820309168177154)

Display - options dictating what shows when ctrl is held.
hShapes - procedural shapes for users to insert and get started with
Modifiers - add modifiers on the fly w/ adjustable dots for certain ones
Misc - mirror is the only option here for now.

# Building from a vert

Collapsing a cube to a vert and using handles to guide spins and then add mirroring, decimation, solidification, and 3 levels of bevels can be a fun way to wrap your head around the process.
