# hopsTool

HardOps version 983 introduces the first active tool of Hard Ops called hopsTool. We intend for this tool to provide a simple ui to assist with modifier management for non destructive modelling in the 3d view.

If boxcutter is not installed the hotkey is alt + shift + W.

If boxcutter is installed then hopsTool is swapable with alt + W.

# Breaking down the UI

[hopsTool will need the topbar to show.](https://twitter.com/mxeon1001/status/1123820309168177154)

Display - options dictating what shows when ctrl is held.
hShapes - procedural shapes for users to insert and get started with
Modifiers - add modifiers on the fly w/ adjustable dots for certain ones
Misc - mirror is the only option here for now.

You are also able to simplify the topbar.

# Boolean dots

While hopsTool is active users can select 2 objects and hold ctrl to bring up boolean dots.
- cut
- join
- slice

are available at this time.

Boolshapes also get their own dot which is where the view can get cluttered quickly.

Fade distance can be adjusted if needed and booldots can be turned off if they are getting in the way.

# Building from a vert

Collapsing a cube to a vert and using handles to guide spins and then add mirroring, decimation, solidification, and 3 levels of bevels can be a fun way to wrap your head around the process.

# Try making a tire from a plane.

By adding a displace, screw and solidify a rim can be made in short time and be dynamically adjustable.

# Things to know

## The topbar can be simplified

## Ctrl + shift clicking dots allow for alternative modification.

Bevel dot adjusts the width but ctrl + shift allows for segment adjust.
The info text up top lets users know whats being adjusted.

On screw ctrl + shift left click dragging adjusts the steps in screw

Simple deform also gets dots for making large adjustments on the fly.

When using hops tool w/ boxcutter and racking bevels the ctrl + add mod behavior adds a mod at 60 degrees which is smoother for going to box city.

## The n panel can display your modifier stack so get in there and look at the mods.

## If you get confused about how a shape is constructed just mod scroll it.
