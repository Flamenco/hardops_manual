At the beginning, [Hard Ops](https://gumroad.com/l/hardops/) was a tool for automating my own workflow. When I first began modelling I adhered to strict modelling guidlines and all quad rules without understanding the why. Robots and hard surface were my primary focus of assets yet topology remained the true decider of my modelling choices and set my design limitations. This ended up causing my models to be [simpler](https://youtu.be/hoaPM1C1vAE) without me truly understanding why.

After the creation of the [Booltool](https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?336498-BoolTool-0-2&p=2659836&viewfull=1#post2659836) and it's introductions into my workflow design became more free flowing. This allowed me to become more intimate with form and design since the workflow required particular edgework for [concept modelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0654GCPxDhw).

So with all that said. [Hard Ops](https://gumroad.com/l/hardops/) is capable of being used in all quad workflows however if [booleans](boolean.md) are introduced the topology becomes something you must [regain control](tips_boolean) of when you choose to take shortcuts. Many operators perform basic tasks while the primary tools have been rewritten over and over to obtain very specific behaviors intended to assist in the workflow of [robot creation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4lbn4).

In my personal opinion, [Hard Ops](https://gumroad.com/l/hardops/) is the end result of years of modelling by hand and clicking and tapping repetitive [hotkeys](hotkeys.md). It is my hope to make a tool that reduces keystrokes and turns processes into steps. As blender evolves so does I aspire this tool to as well. It goes without saying I would not have been able to get it to anywhere this point without a team of people all around the world. Smart minds in the community have contributed great and small to make this tool I once imagined the reality I now bring up when I press [Q](hotkeys.md).
