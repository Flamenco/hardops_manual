## Wishlist / Dreams / Roadmap

> Our roadmap isn't exactly clear until it begins coming together. Certain requisites must
be met for certain features to become viable. This is always dependant on the people
involved and the time / capacity in dealing with features.

We definetely have our eyes on some big features and even some that have already
come to pass. I am always impressed by the capabilities and skills brought to the
table by people who join the team.
